## chromadb-extended by Mintplex Labs

This is an extension on the [original chromadb npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromadb) to enable the ability to use private single-instance Chroma instances to utilize authentication during their requests.


## Getting started

Chroma needs to be running in order for this client to talk to it. Please see the [ðŸ§ª Usage Guide](https://docs.trychroma.com/usage-guide) to learn how to quickly stand this up.

## Small example

```js
import { ChromaClientExtended } from "chromadb-extended";
const chroma = new ChromaClient({
  path: "http://localhost:8000",
  fetchOptions: {
    headers: {
      'X-Api-Token': "sk-live-Hunt3r2", // Works like regular node-fetch headers!
    }
  }
});

```
